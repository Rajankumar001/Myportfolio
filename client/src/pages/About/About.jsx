        <p className="card-about-text "> Hi, Iâ€™m Rajan Kumar Chaudhary from Darbhanga, Bihar. I completed my schooling at Surya Public School, Nangloi-Delhi, with an impressive grade of 86%, followed by my 12th from D.A.V. Public School, Darbhanga. I am a competitive and positive individual, driven to build a long and successful career in the tech industry.
        I have actively participated in several hackathons, where I gained valuable experience in time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. These experiences have shaped my ability to work efficiently under pressure and collaborate effectively in teams, skills that I aim to carry forward in my professional journey.
